# Why Your Brain Won’t Stop Overthinking

Anxiety often shows up as **“what if…”** thoughts that spiral:

- “What if I fail this exam?”  
- “What if my friends secretly don’t like me?”  
- “What if I say something wrong and embarrass myself?”  

Your brain is trying to protect you by scanning for danger. The problem is that it treats many everyday situations as if they are life-or-death, even when they are not.

Overthinking usually:

- Jumps to the worst-case scenario  
- Ignores neutral or positive possibilities  
- Makes you feel stuck instead of taking useful action  

One way to respond is to gently **question the thought**:

- “What is the evidence for and against this?”  
- “Has this happened every time, or just sometimes?”  
- “If a friend told me this, what would I say to them?”  

You don’t need to force yourself to be “positive”. The goal is to move from *“this will definitely be a disaster”* to *“I don’t know for sure, and there are also other possible outcomes.”*

If anxiety regularly interferes with your sleep, concentration or daily life, professional support can help you understand it better and build more personalised coping strategies. You are not alone in feeling this way.
