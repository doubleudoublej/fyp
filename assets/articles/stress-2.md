# Small Breaks, Big Difference

When you’re stressed and overloaded, “self-care” can sound like something that needs extra time, money or energy you don’t have. The good news: your body and brain can benefit a lot from **small, intentional breaks** spread across the day.

Think of your attention like a phone battery. If you never plug it in, it will eventually shut down – usually at the worst possible time. Tiny recharging moments can help:

- 30–60 seconds of slow breathing between tasks  
- Standing up and stretching at your desk  
- Looking away from your screen and out of a window  
- Drinking a glass of water before starting the next thing  

These micro-breaks don’t have to be perfect or aesthetic. They just need to be **real pauses** where your mind gets a moment away from pressure.

You can experiment with a simple structure:

1. **Work for a focused block** (e.g. 25 minutes)  
2. **Take a 3–5 minute break**  
3. Repeat 3–4 times, then take a longer break  

During breaks, try to avoid switching to another “busy” activity (like intense social media scrolling about work or other people’s achievements). Instead, choose something that feels neutral or calming.

Over time, these small habits can reduce the feeling that stress is “endless”. They won’t remove deadlines, but they can make your nervous system more able to cope with them. If you’re not sure where to start, pick one tiny break you can add today and build from there.
