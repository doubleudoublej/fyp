# Setting Boundaries Without Feeling Guilty

Many people feel stressed not only because of workload, but also because they find it hard to say “no”. You might worry about disappointing others, being seen as unhelpful, or missing out on opportunities.

Boundaries are not about caring less. They are about **caring sustainably**.

Here are some gentle ways to start:

- Instead of “I’ll do everything”, try:  
  > “I can help with this part, but I won’t be able to take on the whole thing.”  

- Instead of replying immediately, try:  
  > “Let me check my schedule and get back to you.”  

This gives you space to decide instead of agreeing automatically.

You can ask yourself:

- If I say yes, what am I saying no to? (sleep, rest, my own work?)  
- Will I be resentful later if I take this on?  

Feeling guilty at first is very normal, especially if you’re used to over-giving. Guilt is just a sign that you’re doing something new, not that you’re doing something wrong.

Over time, people who genuinely care about you will adjust to your boundaries. Those who only value you for what you can do for them may react negatively – and that information is important too.

If boundary-setting feels particularly hard or tied to past experiences, talking about it with a counsellor can provide deeper insight and support.
