# Exam Anxiety: Managing the Pressure to Perform

Exams can bring up strong anxiety, especially when grades feel tied to your future, family expectations or self-worth. Feeling nervous before an exam is normal, but if anxiety becomes overwhelming, it can interfere with performance and well-being.

Here are a few practical approaches:

1. **Separate preparation from prediction**  
   Instead of “I’m going to fail”, try:  
   > “I don’t know the outcome yet, but I can focus on what’s in my control today.”

2. **Study in realistic blocks**  
   Break revision into small topics and use time blocks (e.g. 25–30 minutes) with short breaks. This reduces the feeling of “I must understand everything at once.”

3. **Simulate the exam environment**  
   Practise with timed questions in a quiet space. This can reduce the shock of exam conditions and increase familiarity.

4. **Plan exam-day routines**  
   Simple things like preparing materials the night before, planning transport, and eating something light can free up mental energy.

If exam anxiety becomes so strong that you blank out, feel panicky or avoid exams altogether, consider speaking to your school’s counselling service or academic advisor. There may be additional support options such as handling exam accommodations or learning specific coping strategies.
