# Feeling Lonely Even When You’re Not Alone

It’s possible to be surrounded by people – classmates, roommates, followers online – and still feel lonely. Loneliness is less about the **number** of people around you and more about whether you feel **understood, accepted and connected**.

You might feel lonely when:

- You don’t feel safe to be your real self  
- You are always the one listening, but rarely feel heard  
- You have many casual friends but few deeper connections  

A gentle first step is to notice where you feel **a bit more like yourself**. Is it with one particular friend, in a certain club, or even in online spaces where people share similar struggles?  

You don’t need to instantly open up about everything. You can start small:

- Sharing a personal interest or hobby  
- Admitting “I’ve been a bit off lately”  
- Asking someone how they *really* are, and listening with curiosity  

Relationships take time to grow. Not every attempt will lead to a strong bond, and that’s okay. You are allowed to try, adjust and try again.

If loneliness feels persistent and heavily tied to self-worth, it may help to explore this with a counsellor, who can help you understand relational patterns and build healthier, more fulfilling connections.
