# Grounding Yourself in the Present Moment

When anxiety spikes, your body and mind can feel like they are spinning: racing heart, shallow breathing, dizziness, tight chest, difficulty focusing. In those moments, it can help to **ground yourself in the present**, using your senses and your breathing.

Here are two simple techniques you can try:

### 1. 5–4–3–2–1 Senses Exercise

Look around and slowly notice:

- 5 things you can see  
- 4 things you can touch  
- 3 things you can hear  
- 2 things you can smell  
- 1 thing you can taste  

Move through each step gently. The goal is not perfection, but bringing your attention back to what is actually around you.

### 2. Slowed Breathing

- Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds  
- Hold for 2-3 seconds  
- Breathe out slowly through your mouth for 6 seconds  
- Repeat for 5-10 breaths  

Longer exhales send a calming signal to your nervous system.

These tools don’t remove the underlying causes of anxiety, but they can make intense moments more manageable. Afterwards, you can reflect on what triggered the anxiety and consider longer-term support such as therapy, lifestyle changes or academic adjustments if needed.
