# When It’s Time to Protect Your Emotional Space

Sometimes, stress and emotional pain don’t only come from tasks or exams, but also from relationships. This could be with friends, family, partners, or even group project teammates.

Signs that a relationship may be affecting your emotional well-being include:

- Frequently feeling drained, anxious or “small” after interactions  
- Being mocked, belittled or constantly criticised  
- Feeling pressured to ignore your own boundaries or values  

Protecting your emotional space can involve:

- Limiting how often you interact with certain people  
- Changing the topics you’re willing to discuss  
- Saying “no” to requests that feel uncomfortable or unfair  

You are allowed to prioritise your mental health, even if others don’t fully understand. Setting boundaries does not automatically mean cutting people off; sometimes it simply means adjusting the **distance** and **frequency** of contact.

In some situations, especially where there is ongoing emotional, verbal or physical harm, it may be important to seek help from trusted adults, counsellors or relevant authorities. You deserve to feel safe and respected in your relationships.

If you want, I can also:

- Generate a **shorter preview version** (e.g. first 2–3 lines) for use in your Cards in the Articles page  
- Help you convert this into a **seed SQL script** or JSON-with-body for seeding your MySQL DB  
- Or tweak the tone to be slightly more “studenty” or slightly more formal depending on your examiners.
