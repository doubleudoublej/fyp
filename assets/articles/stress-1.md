# When Everything Feels Urgent: Understanding Everyday Stress

University life often feels like a long list of deadlines, notifications and expectations. Assignments, family, friends, internships, future plans – it can start to feel like everything is equally urgent and equally important.

Stress itself is not “bad”. In small amounts, it can help you focus and get things done. The problem comes when stress is **constant** and your body never really gets to switch off. You might notice:

- Trouble relaxing even when you have free time  
- Irritability or snapping at people you care about  
- Headaches, tight shoulders or difficulty sleeping  
- Feeling like you’re always “behind”, no matter what you do  

These are early signs that your stress system is overworked, not proof that you’re weak or incapable.

One helpful first step is simply **noticing your stress signals**. Ask yourself:

- Where do I usually feel stress in my body? (head, chest, stomach?)  
- When during the day is it usually worst?  
- What types of situations trigger it most (e.g. emails, exams, group chats)?  

Once you can recognise your own pattern, it becomes easier to respond intentionally instead of reacting on autopilot.

You do not need to overhaul your whole life overnight. Often, small changes – like taking short breaks between tasks, slowing down your breathing before starting work, or reducing one unnecessary commitment – can already reduce the load on your mind.

If stress has started affecting your sleep, appetite or daily functioning for a while, it may be helpful to speak with a counsellor or mental health professional for more personalised support. Reaching out is a sign of responsibility, not failure.
