# When Motivation Disappears

There are days when even simple things – getting out of bed, replying to messages, starting an assignment – feel extremely heavy. It can be tempting to label yourself as “lazy” or “useless”, but low motivation is often a **signal of emotional exhaustion**, not a character flaw.

When mood is low for a long time, your brain may start protecting you by conserving energy. You might notice:

- Wanting to stay in bed even when you know there are things to do  
- Losing interest in activities you used to enjoy  
- Feeling numb, empty or disconnected  
- Criticising yourself for not being “productive enough”  

One helpful approach is to **shrink your tasks**. Instead of “finish project”, try:

- Open the document  
- Write one sentence  
- Set a 5-minute timer and see what happens  

Every tiny action still counts as movement. On difficult days, the goal is not to perform at 100%, but to do *one manageable thing* that keeps you gently connected to life.

If low mood, emptiness or loss of interest has been present most days for several weeks, it may be a sign of depression. Online tools can provide initial screenings, but they do not replace a professional assessment. A mental health professional can help you understand what you are going through and explore treatment options. You deserve support, not self-blame.
