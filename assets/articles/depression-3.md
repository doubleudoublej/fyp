# You Don’t Have to Go Through This Alone

When mood is low, it’s common to feel like a burden or to believe that no one will understand. That can make reaching out feel risky or pointless.

But isolation often makes painful feelings stronger.

Support doesn’t always have to start with a huge conversation. You could try:

- Telling a friend: “I’ve been feeling off lately, can I talk to you about it?”  
- Messaging someone: “Today has been rough. Could we just chat about random things?”  
- Sharing with a counsellor: “I don’t fully know what I’m feeling, but I know I’m not okay.”  

You don’t need perfect words to deserve support.

If you’re not ready to talk directly about emotions, you can begin with practical help:

- Studying together  
- Walking together  
- Eating a meal with someone  

These small points of contact can make you feel less alone, even without heavy topics.

If you ever experience thoughts of self-harm or feel like you might act on them, it is important to seek immediate help from local emergency services, hotlines, or crisis support in your country. Your safety matters more than any assignment, expectation or fear of judgment.
