# Tiny Wins on Heavy Days

On heavy days, long to-do lists can feel impossible. When everything feels like “too much”, it can help to redefine what a **“win”** looks like.

Consider creating a “minimum list” for rough days:

- Get out of bed at least once  
- Drink water and eat something small  
- Take a shower or wash your face  
- Reply to one important message or email  

If you do more, that’s a bonus — but not a requirement.

You can also use the “five-minute rule”:  

> “I’ll try this for five minutes. After that, I can stop if I really need to.”

Often, starting is the hardest part. Even if you stop after five minutes, you’ve still taken a step.

It may also help to **separate your feelings from your identity**.  
Instead of “I am a failure”, try reframing it as:

- “I am having a really hard day.”  
- “My energy is low, but that doesn’t define my worth.”

When difficult days become frequent, reaching out to trusted people or professionals can provide support and options. You are not meant to carry everything alone, and asking for help is a courageous step.
